      b. insert a child per level and per parent names
      c. find list of people per full name and per parents full names

The project topic is described below (Please work together):

      c. find list of persons per full name and per parents full names
      d. find list of all direct grand-parents
      e. find list of all direct grand-mothers
      f. find list of all direct grand-fathers
      g. find list of grand parents per tree level
      h. update informations of specific person per tree level and per full name
      i. delete a specific person from the tree per level and full name

2. Justify the algorithm choice. what is its order? Is it optimized?

3. Implement the algorithm in Java and add GUI to interact with the Genealogy trees. Each person full name will be displayed in a circle and circles will be linked together by lines.
